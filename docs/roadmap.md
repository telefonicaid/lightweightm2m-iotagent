# IoT Agent for OMA LightWeight Machine2Machine Roadmap

This product is a FIWARE Generic Enabler. If you would like to learn about the overall Roadmap of FIWARE, please check
"Roadmap" on the [FIWARE Catalogue](https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/).

### Introduction

This section elaborates on proposed new features or tasks which are expected to be added to the product in the
foreseeable future. There should be no assumption of a commitment to deliver these features on specific dates or in the
order given. The development team will be doing their best to follow the proposed dates and priorities, but please bear
in mind that plans to work on a given feature or task may be revised. All information is provided as general guidelines
only, and this section may be revised to provide newer information at any time.

At the present moment, this compoment is in manteinance mode. Evolution will be driven by customer needs.
Thus, there is no explicit description of short/medium/long term roadmap items, although you can have
a look to the current list of issues [here](https://github.com/telefonicaid/lightweightm2m-iotagent/issues).

Take also into acount that this IoT Agent uses the 
[FIWARE IoT Agent Node.js Library](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib) framework. This is why most of the 
functionalities of this component depend on the new features of the library itself. You can have a look to the IoT Agent 
Node Library Roadmap 
[here](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib/blob/master/doc/roadmap.md).

Please feel free to contact us if you wish to get involved in the implementation or influence the roadmap.
